# Misaka Mikoto (50)

## Problem

My friends like anime way too much . . . they decided that to give me an encoded [message](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/misaka/message.txt), but I can't solve it because I'm not a weeb!

## Hint

railguns are cool

## Write-Up

(If there are website problems, the string was rasfsasrettlepinebec353luteayvlrghs3s if you want to follow along.)
If you're a weeaboo like me, you've probably watched A Certain Magical Index or A Certain Scientific Railgun (toaru majitsu no index and toaru kagaku no railgun). Or you could use their wikia. Anyways, after watching Index or Railgun, we know that Misaka is an esper - one of the only 2 level 5 espers. We also know that her "codename" is railgun.

This is a crypto problem, and the hint says `railguns are cool`, so we can infer that "railgun" is relevant. We go on rumkin and see that there is a cipher called the railfence cipher. Plugging in our string, and setting 5 rails since Misaka is level 5, we get this string - and the flag!
